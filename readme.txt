--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

(a) Basic features
- Image on the home screen, image in About Me page, image on Projects page

- I have custom icons on the contact page for the LinkedIn logo, Email logo, and smartphone logo.


(b) CSS features
- I modified the LinkedIn link to remove the underline on the text.
- I used Bootstrap to help make a hoverable table and used CSS to remove the table border for a cleaner look on the Contact page.
- I used Google fonts to change the font of my text in all of my pages. Used generic font-family as a fallback to the Google Fonts.
- I used CSS to change the color of the card behind my picture in the About Me page.


(c) Advanced features
- I created a table with multiple columns and rows and used scope to tell the screen reader which cells are columns in the Contact page.
- I also added a navigation bar that remains at the top of every page on the website, remains consistent.
- I created a Contact page that does not need a form to create an email but rather created a link that creates an instant email draft.
